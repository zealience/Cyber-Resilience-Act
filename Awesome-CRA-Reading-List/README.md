# Awesome CRA Reading List

The goal of this page is to aggregate relevant documents and resources to help manufacturers prepare for the CRA. We provide links and short summaries covering various topics such as:
 - Offical text and communications
 - Standardization status
 - Guidance published by various industry players

This list is a work in progress and will be regularly updated. Do not hesitate to open a PR if you have suggestions!

## Official EC communication and resources:

 - [Cyber Resilience Act - Implementation](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/factpages/cyber-resilience-act-implementation): Portal where the EC communicates about the CRA.
 - [Frequently Asked Questions on the CRA implementation](https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/redirection/document/122331)
 - [Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2025/2392 of 28 November 2025](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32025R2392&qid=1764577062755): Technical description of the categories of important and critical products


### Future guidance expected as per CRA Art. 26:
 - (a) The scope of the CRA, with a particular focus on **remote data processing solutions** and **free and open-source software**;
 - (b) The **application of support periods** in relation to particular categories of products with digital elements;
 - (c) Guidance targeted at manufacturers subject to the CRA that are **also subject to Union harmonisation legislation other than the CRA** or to other related Union legal acts;
 - (d) The **concept of substantial modification**


### Repeal of the RED DA:
"This [initiative aims to repeal Delegated Regulation 2022/30 on cybersecurity](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/14766-Cybersecurity-repeal-of-Delegated-Regulation-supplementing-the-Radio-Equipment-Directive_en) once the Cyber Resilience Act becomes fully applicable on 11 December 2027.
This will avoid any overlaps between the essential requirements of the Radio Equipment Directive that relate to cybersecurity and those of the Cyber Resilience Act. It will also ensure legal certainty."

**Status**: Feedback period now closed. **Commission adoption expected in Q1 2026.**

### Notified Bodies

"The Commission requested the development of 15 horizontal standards, which the European Standardisation Organisations (ESOs) have clustered in 3 deliverables:
 - A harmonised European standard on designing, developing and producing products with digital elements in such a way that they ensure an appropriate level of cybersecurity based on the risks;
 - A harmonised European standard on vulnerability handling for products with digital elements
 - A harmonised European standard covering the essential cybersecurity requirements relating to the properties of products with digital elements as set out in Part I of Annex I" (CRA FAQ, p.63)


### Vertical standards:

"Vertical standards are meant to be product specific and to cover a specific set of risks appropriate to a particular intended purpose and reasonably foreseeable use. The Commission requested the development of 26 vertical standards (which the ESOs are addressing through 31 separate deliverables) to be adopted by the ESOs by 30 October 2026. The vertical standards under development cover the categories of important and critical products with digital elements set out in Annexes III and IV of CRA." (CRA FAQ, p.63)
