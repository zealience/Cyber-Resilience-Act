# Cyber Resilience Act Compliance Resources

## Welcome to the Zealience CRA GitHub repository

In this repository, you will find resources to assist you with CRA compliance. Similar to our EN 18031/RED DA repo, our goal is to support manufacturers of connected products in navigating smoothly toward CRA compliance.

We intend to publish resources over time, so come back regularly to check them out.

Please star this repo, your support means a lot to us! Thanks in advance!
